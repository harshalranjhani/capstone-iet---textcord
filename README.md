## TEXTCORD

textcord is a chat application made using React, Node.js, Express.js and Mongo DB.

## To run the app locally:

run

> npm install

in the root folder.
Head to the client folder and then the "textcord" folder. Run

> npm start

This will start the frontend react app.
For the backend, run
> mongod
in the windows powershell. For this make sure that you have all the dependencies installed.
Head over to the server section and run
> nodemon index.js
This should start the server and also connect to the MongoDB database locally on your device.

You can now register yourself as a user on the app and add contacts accordingly.
Still working on the socket.io part, but the contacts can be added and the conversations can be seen.
